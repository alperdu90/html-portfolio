<h1>My Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movie franchises of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>The original trilogy is amazing. 
The 4th film doesn't fit in the trilogy but I like it
regardless. There is also Animatrix which is a series of 
short animated films from the Matrix universe. That is also
very good.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>The Lotr has three movies and they are all amazing.
There are also extended versions that deserve a rewatch. 
I think we can also put the Hobbit trilogy into the Lotr
franchise. I like the Hobbit movies as well.</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>It has three movies. I like them all. A true classic.</p>
